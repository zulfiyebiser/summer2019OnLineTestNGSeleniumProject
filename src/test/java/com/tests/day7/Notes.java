    if can find locator with css try fist if cannot use xpath
    id==>css==>xpath..
    can be like ==> html=skeleton ; javaScript= muscles ; css=skin
    to check is id unique(to specify id) ==> #valueOfId
    css is faster than xpath
    xpath is a type of locator that is used in Selenium to find elements.
    Xpath was originally create for XML documents, but it also supports HTML documents.
     Since every single web application consists of HTML, we can use Xpath with HTML documents as well.
    We have 2 types of xpath: relative and absolute
    absolute xpath must start from root element.
    In HTML it's a <html> tag

    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My personal page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
        <h4>Please subscribe for updates</h4>
        <form>
            <span>Enter your email:</span>
            <input type="text" name="email">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
    How to get to the input box? /html/body/form/input
    html has 2 children: head and body, then body has 3 children: h1 , h4 and form, then form has 2 children:
    span and input.
    Example 2:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My personal page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
        <h4>Please enter your info</h4>
        <form>
            <span>Enter your name:</span>
            <input type="text" name="name">
            <br>
            <span>Enter your phone number:</span>
            <input type="tel" name="phone">
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>
    How to create a locator for phone number?
    /html/body/form/input[2]

    Bitrix warning message:
    /html/body/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/div/div/div[2]
    Vytrack warning message:
    /html/body/div[1]/div/div/div/div[1]/form/fieldset/div[1]/div
    Relative xpath can start from anywhere.
    It must start with // and then you can use tag name, attributes, text, to create a locator:
    For example, for bitrix warning message:
    //div[@class='errortext'] either '' or "", better '' because "" in java used for strings.
    //tagName[@attribute='value']
    * - any tag name (a,input,button, div, body, etc.)
    //input[@value='Log In']
    What if we don't have exact value, only beginning part?
    then we can use starts-with:
    syntax: //tag[starts-with(@attribute, 'value')]
    //input[starts-with(@onclick, 'BX')]
    //input[starts-with(@value, 'Log')]
    It works, only if it's beginning of value/text
    If value has '', then use "" in the xpath:
    //input[@onclick="BX.addClass(this, 'wait');"]
    To find element based on text, use text(), instead of @attribute.
    //a[starts-with(text(), 'Forgot')] - equals to beginning of the phrase.
    //*[text()='Text'] - equals to exact text
    How about partial text???
    we can use contains. Contains will help us to find element based on partial text/value regardless of location.
    //*[contains(text(),'Incorrect')]
    //*[contains(@title,'Activity Stream')]
    (//button)[3] - nth element of matching
    //button[3] - 3rd child
    To go to parent element: /..
    Example:
    //*[text()='Text']/.. | from the text to parent element

    How basic CSS selector looks like:
    tagName[attribute='value'] | no //, no @, xpath would look like: //tagName[@attribute='value']
    IN CSS, WE CAN SPECIFY ID LIKE THIS: #id
    for example: #disappearing_button
    also, it work like this: [id='disappearing_button']
    For class name, in css we use .
    .class
    example: .h3 - it means, find element with class name h3
    also, it works like this: [class='h3']
    If, class name has a space, that means you need to put . in between. Because, space, in the class, it's a delimiter for different classes.
    <button class="btn btn-info">Click Me</button>
    [class='btn btn-primary'][name='button2'] - to specify 2 attributes
    How about contains?
    sure, we just put * after attribute
    [attribute*='value'] - value can be partial, same like contains(@attribute,'value') in xpath
    [id*='d'] - example, means that some element contains d in the id value
    to match beginning of the attribute value, we use caret symbol: ^
     java_boy    _____
                 (^_^)
                 /| |\
    How about end of the attribute?
    [id$='end_of_value'] | $ means attribute ends with value
    * - contains
    ^ - starts with
    $ - ends with
    button[onclick="button4()"] or button[onclick='button4()']
    in code: By.cssSelector
    How we can move from parent to child element in css selector?
    "space" or ">"
    div input
    What's the difference between space and > ? space in between means any child (can be grand, or grand grand child ) > means only direct child.
    .container > h3 - means find element with h3 tag name, that has direct parent with class name container.
    parent > child
